The '''Utah Hockey Club''' is a professional [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Salt Lake City]]. The team competes in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) as a member of the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]] in the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]], and began play as an [[expansion team]] during the league's [[2024–25 NHL season|2024–25 season]]. The team plays its home games at the [[Delta Center]], an arena they share with the [[Utah Jazz]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA).
The team was created on April 18, 2024, with the NHL Board of Governors granting an expansion franchise to Jazz owner [[Ryan Smith (businessman)|Ryan Smith]]. In lieu of an [[expansion draft]] to stock the new team, Smith acquired the hockey assets (players, coaching staff, and draft picks) of the [[Arizona Coyotes]], which suspended hockey operations at the same time.<ref name="BOG announcement">{{cite news|author=NHL Public Relations|title=NHL BOG approves establishment of new franchise in Utah|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-bog-approves-establishment-of-new-franchise-in-utah|publisher=NHL Enterprises, L.P.|website=NHL.com|date=April 18, 2024|access-date=April 18, 2024}}</ref> The team is playing its inaugural season in 2024–25 with a temporary name and colors, while a full identity is developed for 2025–26.<ref name="DetwilerNHL">{{cite news|last=Detwiler|first=Christopher|title=Utah releases 20 finalists for team name, unveils fan vote|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/utah-fan-vote-on-team-name|publisher=NHL Enterprises, L.P.|website=NHL.com|date=May 8, 2024|access-date=May 20, 2024}}</ref><ref name="UtahNHLNameESPN">{{cite news|title=Utah offers 20 team name ideas, including Frost, Hive, Venom|url=https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/40111549/utah-offers-20-team-name-ideas-including-frost-hive-venom|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures, LLC|website=ESPN.com|date=May 8, 2024|access-date=May 9, 2024}}</ref> The team's name, colors, and jerseys for their inaugural season were revealed on June 13, 2024.<ref name="UtahNHLTeamID">{{cite news|title=This Is Utah's Team|url=https://www.nhl.com/utah/news/this-is-utah-s-team|publisher=NHL Enterprises, L.P.|website=NHL.com/Utah|date=June 13, 2024|access-date=June 14, 2024|language=en}}</ref>

}}

Prior to the arrival of the NHL, Salt Lake City had limited ice hockey history. The first team to call the area home, the minor-league [[Salt Lake Golden Eagles]], played 25 seasons across the [[Western Hockey League (1952-1974)|Western Hockey League]] (WHL), [[Central Professional Hockey League|Central Hockey League]] (CHL), and [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|International Hockey League]] (IHL) from 1969 to 1994. Playing out of the [[Salt Palace (arena)|Salt Palace]] for their first 22 seasons and the then-new [[Delta Center]] for their final three, the Golden Eagles won two [[Adams Cup (ice hockey)|Adams Cup]] championships in the CHL and two [[Turner Cup]] championships in the IHL, before ultimately being sold and relocating to [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]], as the [[Detroit Vipers]] after the [[1993–94 IHL season]].

After just one season out of ice hockey, Salt Lake City received another IHL franchise in 1995, as the reigning Turner Cup champion [[Utah Grizzlies (1995–2005)|Denver Grizzlies]], having been replaced by the newly relocated [[Colorado Avalanche]] of the NHL, relocated to the Delta Center for the [[1995–96 AHL season|1995–96 season]] as the Utah Grizzlies. The Grizzlies spent two seasons in Salt Lake City proper, including a second consecutive Turner Cup championship in 1996; notably, the Cup-clinching game 4 of the Turner Cup Finals saw an attendance of 17,381, at the time the largest attendance in minor-league ice hockey history.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Turner|first=Tim|date=June 9, 1996|title=ORLANDO OUSTED IN OT|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1996-06-09-9606090196-story.html|website=[[Orlando Sentinel]]}}</ref> The Grizzlies later moved to the newly constructed [[Maverik Center|E Center]] (since renamed the Maverik Center) in the suburb of [[West Valley City, Utah|West Valley City]] for the [[1997–98 AHL season|1997–98 IHL season]], and joined the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) in [[2001–02 AHL season|2001]] alongside five other surviving IHL franchises upon the latter's collapse. However, the Grizzlies voluntarily suspended operations for the [[2005–06 AHL season|2005–06 season]], before being sold to [[Dan Gilbert]], the owner of the NBA's [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and relocating to [[Cleveland]], as the [[Cleveland Monsters|Lake Erie Monsters]] (later Cleveland Monsters) for the [[2007–08 AHL season|2007–08 season]].

The AHL iteration of the Grizzlies were subsequently replaced by a relocated [[ECHL]] franchise [[Utah Grizzlies|of the same name]]; the franchise had most recently played in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], as the [[Lexington Men O' War]] but had become dormant after the [[2002–03 ECHL season]]. The new Grizzlies began play out of the E Center in [[2005–06 ECHL season|2005]], immediately after their AHL predecessor had gone dormant, and have played 19 seasons in the ECHL since. However, the franchise has been comparatively unsuccessful; although they have missed the playoffs only three times, they have won just one division championship and no conference championships, only having reached the conference finals twice.

The Delta Center has hosted multiple [[Los Angeles Kings]] preseason games as part of the NHL's [[Frozen Fury]] series.<ref>{{cite news|title=LA Kings to Play Frozen Fury Preseason Game in Salt Lake City|url=https://www.nhl.com/kings/news/la-kings-to-play-frozen-fury-preseason-game-in-salt-lake-city-325331344|publisher=NHL Enterprises, L.P.|website=LAKings.com|date=June 15, 2021|access-date=October 1, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kslsports.com/493868/frozen-fury-vivint-arena-nhl-preseason-la-kings-vegas-golden-knights/|title=Salt Lake City Shows Out For Frozen Fury NHL Game|date=October 6, 2021}}</ref> However, the arena was not considered well suited to host ice hockey permanently, owing to poor sightlines and broadcasting capabilities.<ref>{{cite web |last=Larsen |first=Andy |url=https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2023/10/06/nhls-only-utahn-trevor-lewis/ |title=The NHL's only Utahn thinks the state is ready for hockey's best.

====Establishment of the team====
[[File:Delta Center with Arena Station.jpg|thumb|The [[Delta Center]], where the Utah Hockey Club plays its home games]]
Salt Lake City initially emerged as a potential NHL destination in June 2023, with rumors regarding the [[Arizona Coyotes]]' potential relocation spreading after the failure of the [[New Tempe Arena]] referendum.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cluff |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nhl/coyotes/2023/06/06/arizona-coyotes-nhl-relocation-speculation-salt-lake-city-utah/70295512007/ |title=Arizona Coyotes to Salt Lake City?

Discussions to bring an expansion team to the city were revealed to have been underway since early 2022,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fox |first1=Derick |title=Utah sports mogul Ryan Smith submits bid to bring NHL to Salt Lake City |url=https://www.abc4.com/sports/utah-ryan-smith-submits-bid-to-bring-nhl-to-salt-lake-city/ |website=ABC4 |date=January 24, 2024 |access-date=January 27, 2024}}</ref> with the [[Utah State Senate]] passing tax legislation in February 2024 to support a new ice hockey-capable downtown arena proposed by Smith; the only condition asked by the Senate was that any potential team be branded "Utah" to honor the state in general, as opposed to any branding using Salt Lake City.<ref>{{cite web |last=Romboy |first=Dennis |url=https://www.deseret.com/2024/02/27/salt-lake-city-raise-sales-tax-build-nhl-arena/ |title=Utah Senate passes bill for potential downtown hockey arena |website=Deseret News |date=February 27, 2024 |access-date=March 29, 2024}}</ref>

On April 13, 2024, it was reported that, with the NHL's permission, the Coyotes were making efforts to relocate to Salt Lake City following concerns about an indefinite timeframe on a new arena and the effects of continued play at the 4,600-seat [[Mullett Arena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/39966564/coyotes-bid-arizona-farewell-bittersweet-win-oilers|title=Coyotes bid Arizona farewell with bittersweet win over Oilers|date=April 17, 2024|access-date=April 18, 2024|website=ESPN.com |quote=There could be a new arena -- eventually. Meruelo had been pursuing a tract of land in north Phoenix to build it. When delays pushed the land auction until June, the NHL and the players' association got cold feet about continuing to play at Mullett Arena, the loud-but-bandbox-sized venue shared with Arizona State University. Meruelo was adamant about not selling the team despite constant offers since he bought in 2019, but he also didn't want the players stuck playing in a 5,000-seat arena -- by far the NHL's smallest -- that wasn't up to league standards.
